# udacity-build-a-portfolio-site

This is a working draft of my "Build A Portfolio Site" project for the Udacity Frontend Developer Nanodegree Grow With Google scholarship.

The site is my best representation of the project rubric. 

The HTML and CSS files are commented. I will complete the navigation section with an animated sliding menu including href links to the designated page areas. plan to complete is the navagation I need to add functionality to the site as I learn JavaScript.
